This program will print Nth fibonacci number

Function main
Declare integer n,first,second,temp,i
     Assign first =1
     Assign  Second=0
print response
  "enter the value of n which you want the value"
	get Input 'n' from user
 for i=1 to n with increasing by one in next iteration,next
    Assign  temp = first + second
    Assign  first = second
    Assign  second = temp
End For loop when the given condition is not satisfied 
Display temp (the value of the corresponding n)
